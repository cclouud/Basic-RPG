# üïπÔ∏è Basic Typescript Videogame

A basic Typescript videogame that I created for school using HTML, CSS, and Typescript. Please note that it is not responsive, so keep that in mind when viewing it.

You can also visit [my web](https://basicrpg.cclouud.dev/) to see it live online. (Don't forget to resize your window for the best experience!)
